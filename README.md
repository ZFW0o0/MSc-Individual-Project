In this project, we provide two implementations of our SR-3D-U-Net model.

In the first contribution, we implement a 3D U-Net model, a model conventionally used on medical image semantic segmentation tasks. This application of 3D U-Net proved the model's robustness and wide applicability in tasks other than those it has been designed for. We share the quantitative evaluations obtained with this model on the UK Digital Heart dataset, along with an examination of the constraints of our suggested approach and recommendations for potential avenues of future research.

For the second contribution, we build upon the model implemented in the first contribution and proposed methods including SDF-3D-U-Net and data augmentation. The SDF-3D-U-Net significantly outperforms the baseline model and we have provided both quantitative comparisons and theoretical explanations for our observations. We also address the constraints of our approach and offer recommendations for further investigations.
